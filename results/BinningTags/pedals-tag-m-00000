After riding for a while with cleats I decided to go back to regular pedals as I had trouble getting used to the SPDs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;With cleats power is decreased dramatically. It's became much harder for me to stick with fast riding group.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;After riding, muscles are aching.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's became more difficult to pick up speed at the start.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most likely that's because others groups of muscles are working. However, more than one month passed and I feel like I am still much faster with regular shoes. With regular pedals I used to ride with middle of the foot over the pedal. That is the main difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One more thing - uncomfortable feeling in my knees. However, cleats position are set up completely fine, according to multiple instructions and tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm wondering, if anyone have ever faced with same issue when starts to use cleats. What changes can you suggest trying to alleviate the problems I have described? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7978" LastEditorUserId="3924" LastEditDate="2013-08-30T03:47:17.483" LastActivityDate="2013-09-02T00:26:38.587" Title="Difficulties with cleat pedals" Tags="&lt;mountain-bike&gt;&lt;pedals&gt;&lt;cleat&gt;" AnswerCount="5" CommentCount="9" />
