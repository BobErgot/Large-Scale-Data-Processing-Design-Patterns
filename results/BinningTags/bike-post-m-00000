Recently it slipped back (so that the nose sticks up).  I loosened the bolt under the saddle, tilted the saddle back into the proper position, tightened the bolt up, and within a week the nose had tilted back up. Did the same thing again, but cranked the bolt even tighter; still happened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I noticed that there's visible &quot;scarring&quot; or scraping on the top of the seat tube where the clamp that holds the saddle (not sure the proper term for those pieces) grabs onto the tube.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a 2009 Surly Long Haul Trucker (touring style bike; equipped like a commuter) with the stock seatpost (pretty sure it's 27.2mm.  No real branding on the seat post).  I'm a fairly heavy rider (near 250 pounds) and I do sometimes ride over some pretty rough stuff, so I suspect that might be part of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So far I'm seeing maybe 3 options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get a hex tool with more leverage and tighten that thing down even more&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some sort of super glue or epoxy (or maybe just a bit of old innertube?) to keep the seatpost from sliding back&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Replace the seatpost (and clamp assembly, of course).

On the right is the bottom piece that sits on top of the seatpost and under the seat rails, there's matching &quot;scarring&quot; at the points that touch the seatpost. On the left is the top piece that goes on top of the rails. On top is the bolt that goes through everything from the bottom (with a curved sort of washer thing that fits into a matching curved area on the seatpost).  The opposite side of the &quot;bottom piece&quot; basically looks just like the visible side of the &quot;top piece&quot;, and the opposite side of the &quot;top piece&quot; is boring.&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/d7Tbu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;clamp pieces&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Used a hex tool with a longer arm (more leverage), removed the bolt, greased it up and tightened it as much as possible, not worrying about damaging the already damaged seatpost further. The grease helps to allow a bit more tightening. This held up for a couple months but eventually seat started sliding back again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final solution&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://bikethomson.com/products/seatposts/elite/&quot;&gt;Thomson Elite seatpost&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the shorter model with a setback in silver ordered through my LBS.

We have an amount of outside space that can host some racks, but we want to buy something that can maximise the numbers held, while hopefully still allowing random access (i.e. any bike can be taken away at any time by its owner). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The current suggestion is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esedirect.co.uk/p-2246-the-s-stand-bike-rack.aspx&quot;&gt;http://www.esedirect.co.uk/p-2246-the-s-stand-bike-rack.aspx&lt;/a&gt; - we've space for about five of these style (i.e. ten bikes). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel sure that we must be able to fit more bikes into the space. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So without knowing the dimensions within which we must work, I'm looking for a few candidate types of solutions which are particularly space efficient. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main problem I think with these 'S' stands that have been proposed is that, when placed against a wall, I think that the asymmetric nature will mean that, when busy, the slot facing the wall is likely to not be used. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I must admit that my initial reaction is that you have to argue as to why to not just get the Sheffield stand.

There are no bike lanes, but in some places, it's wide enough that I can easily pass traffic on the right (which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXIV/Chapter85/Section11b&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;legal&lt;/a&gt; in my state, as far as I can tell), and in some places, there's actually a whole extra lane on the right for a block or two. However, the conditions change from block to block. On some of the blocks, there is not enough room to pass safely on the right of cars, and there are some places where the extra lane on the right no longer exists across the intersection or is filled with parked cars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several times when I've passed cars on the right, either in a full lane or in the room between a lane of stopped cars and parked cars, and then realized after crossing through the next intersection that I need to merge back into the next lane. What is the etiquette of merging back into the next lane in such circumstances?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a few possibilities that I've tried, and all of them seem unsatisfying in certain ways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Continue to travel in the lane that will run out until it actually does, then stop and wait for a gap in the traffic before merging in. That can sometimes require stopping and waiting for quite a while, due to busy traffic.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Signal to the left in advance of running out of the lane, check for a reasonable gap in the cars while still moving, and merge into that gap once I've determined it's safe, or fall back to the first option if that doesn't work. The problem is, this requires a good deal of judgement to tell when there's a good enough gap in traffic to merge back in, I can only glance back quickly and not make good eye contact with drivers in the lane I'm merging into since I need to be paying attention to what's ahead of me as well, and I'm not sure if I'm cutting people off too closely.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pass the cars on the right, then pull up in front of them at a stop light so I can take the lane when it turns green. This makes me feel like a jerk, like I'm cutting in line.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Simply stay in, and take, the lane that doesn't keep disappearing. This is what I would do if I were driving a car.

Besides just using lights, there are plenty of other reflective Doohickeys that purport to make you visible at night.

Just today I was driving downtown and almost hit a biker with the notorious right hook. Luckily we didn't make any contact, but afterwards I recognized why I didn't notice him even though he was wearing a reflective vest and had a decently bright light.

I don't want to talk up the quality too much - while certainly better than what you might find at a box-store like Walmart (those bikes are often non-servicable), but nothing like what you might find on an entry level adult bike. Out of the box, the rims were out of true, the headset was on too tight, and the tires smell like plastic fumes. But this is all fixable since the components are basically like a regular bike. The Skuut, on the other hand, apparently has plastic washers and cheap tires that make the bike overall not as durable.

Here are some of the things that I have been thinking about.  What else would you think about when building a good winter bike.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am specifically building this bike for &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.google.ca/?utm_campaign=en&amp;amp;utm_source=en-ha-na-ca-bk-gm&amp;amp;utm_medium=ha&amp;amp;utm_term=google%20maps&quot;&gt;Ottawa, Ontario, Canada&lt;/a&gt;.  The average January temperature is -10°C (12 °F) but it can get as cold as −30 °C (−22 °F).  I am interested in making a bike that will ride well in both urban and more rural areas.  It should be able to handle snow and ice.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Frame&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Road frames generally have less clearance for wide tires, mud guards etc.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Even when the roads are &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; clear in the winter I often encounter snow filled streets and icy patches.  I am leaning towards a &lt;strong&gt;mountain frame&lt;/strong&gt; because I think that it would be better suited to this kind of semi-technical riding.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have never used &lt;a href=&quot;http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/1195/different-kinds-of-handlebars/1213#1213&quot;&gt;drop bars&lt;/a&gt; in the winter before I really liked having a long handle bar.  I found that this really helped to balance on slippery roads.  Seems like if you want drop bars it is best to start with a road frame because &lt;a href=&quot;http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/1136/upgrading-straight-handlebars-to-drop-handlebars/1139#1139&quot;&gt;adding drop bars looks like a pain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Corrosion -  An aluminum frame will hold up better than a steel frame in the winter.  I think that the salt will do a number on steel, &lt;strong&gt;aluminum&lt;/strong&gt; should hold up better. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Suspension&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last winter I decided that I want to get a new fork this winter without suspension.  In the summer I feel totally comfortable jumping off ledges on my bike.  In the winter I would not want to jump off anything that required suspension because in winter it is too hard to guess what the traction will be like when landing.  I also found that my &lt;a href=&quot;http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/2357/frozen-suspension-in-the-winter&quot;&gt;suspension froze&lt;/a&gt; so even if I had wanted it it would not have helped.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Tires&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Studs help grip on ice but will not help in snowy weather.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wide tires help to float the rider on top of the snow.  If you want to have really wide tires you need to get wider rims.  You can find rims up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allweathersports.com/winter/snowcats.html&quot;&gt;44m wide&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Brakes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love my disk brakes.  They are very reliable and I trust them.  I have not used rim brakes in the winter but I know when they get wet they grip less well.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I want no suspension and disk brakes it is tricky to find a fork.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Lights&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Ottawa the sun can set as early as 4:30.  To see and be seen serious lights are required.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Mud Guards&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last winter I did not use mud guards.  I found generally everything was frozen so I did not get too wet.  I think after I remove my suspension I may add some.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aluminum Mountain Frame&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Disk Brakes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No Suspension&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Studded tires (wide if going in deep snow)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else would you think about when building a bike for the winter?&lt;/strong&gt;  I am hoping to get a used frame and used parts when possible and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/1247/how-to-make-studded-tires&quot;&gt;make the studded tires&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="134" LastEditorUserId="134" LastEditDate="2011-01-13T12:38:12.923" LastActivityDate="2012-12-28T23:23:27.157" Title="What needs to be considered when building a winter bike?"

I cannot really trust the words so the rear brakes (no problem with front brakes) may have discolored oil, a thing to watch for according to Shimanos' &lt;a href=&quot;http://techdocs.shimano.com/media/techdocs/content/cycle/SI/SI_8ES0A_002/SI_8ES0A_002_En_v1_m56577569830616405.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt;.

I heard something like you need a special fork if you are going to put it on a bike that was designed to be used with shocks.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I know that I want a fork with disk break mounts so this makes the search slightly more difficult.

But any feed back would be appreciated.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fork was designed to be used with 700C or 29 inch wheels but it has an axel to crown length of roughly 17 inches (431 mm).  I currently have 100mm Travel in my suspension fork so &lt;a href=&quot;http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/2568/replacing-suspension-with-a-solid-fork/2576#2576&quot;&gt;Lantius says&lt;/a&gt; that I should get a fork with a length of 455 mm (17.9 inches).  Is this reasonable?  Does it matter if it was designed for a 700C tire if the fork length is correct?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the picture of the fork the fork has &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; rake.

Presumably the French and Germans thought that this would be a good idea for road safety and there must be some statistics that prove these laws to not be a waste of time. Presumably these laws did not make cycling so expensive, killing the trade in new bikes and deterring people from cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are there any statistics to show the effect of a change in the law to make lights mandatory with new bicycle sales?&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem for a cyclist is 'I did not see you mate' and one of the biggest complaints that the tin-box people have about cyclists is that they ride at night without lights. Given recent changes in legislation so that cars have to have daytime running lights, shouldn't new bicycles also have to have daytime running lights? Or mandatory lights that the cyclist must use at night and can use during the day?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please put down your thoughts on mandatory bike lights and how this could be implemented. For instance, road bikes that are sold 'without pedals' currently do not have to comply with reflector legislation. Equally, bikes 'without pedals' could be sold without the mandatory lights.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An E.U. (or NAFTA) law could also impose a levy on imported bikes not supplied with lights with the levy being high enough that it is cheaper to supply the lights than pay the levy.&#xA;There is also a matter of wheel size, does a law need to apply to just adult bikes or 'anything that does not have stabilisers'?&#xA;Clearly there are requirements to be seen, but does a cyclist need mandatory lights to see with? Right now the approved lights in the UK are 4 candela, flashing 60-240 times a minute, constant flashing rate.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bounty will hopefully be awarded for useful statistics and/or the makings of a draft UK law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reply from RoSPA regarding why they think lights do not need to be mandatory (see notes below)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your email.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Our policy is not ‘bicycles do not need lights’. Of course cyclists need to use lights in the dark, and we state this very clearly in the first paragraph of the policy you quote. The last paragraph concerns the separate question of whether the law should be changed to require bicycles to be sold with lights already fitted, and we do not believe that there is evidence to support such a change in the law.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Such a law would increase the price of bicycles, and presumably harm after sales of bicycle lights that are sold independently of bicycles because people would be less likely to purchase additional bicycle lights, if their bicycle already had lights fitted. It would also impose the cost of lights on cyclists who never ride in the dark, and so do not need lights.  The advantages would be that it would presumably decrease the number of cyclists riding in the dark without lights, although it would not guarantee this as lights can be removed, just like bells (when the law changed requiring bells to be fitted with new bicycles, people were free to take the bell off outside the shop).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You make an interesting point that the amendments to the Road Vehicle Lighting Regulations that permitted the use of LED lights (flashing or non-flashing) that are more reliable and have longer–lasting battery life mean that cyclists are more likely to use lights than previously. I can see some logic to this, but am not aware of any evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The policy statement on cycle lighting was developed following a review of what little published research there is on the use of cycle lighting that we conducted in 1997 (copy attached). Obviously, this is all very old now, and we will look to see if there is any new research indicating that making it mandatory for cycle lights to be fitted to bicycles when they are sold would be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The latest research into cycling accidents, “Collisions Involving Cyclists on Britain’s Roads: Establishing the Causes”, TRL Report PPR 445, 2009, shows that 78% of cyclist accidents occur in daylight, but accidents in the dark on roads with no street lighting are more likely to be fatal. These accidents more commonly involve the cyclist being struck from the rear, and it is likely that lights, reflectors and high-visibility garments would help to prevent some of these. The same research estimated that ‘Cyclist not displaying lights in the dark or poor visibility” was a factor in 5% of fatal cyclist accidents, and 4% of cyclist accidents resulting in non-fatal injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I repeat, the question is not whether cyclists should use lights in the dark – there is no question that they should do so – but whether requiring bicycles to be sold with lights would decrease the number of cyclists riding in the dark without lights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1997 doc to follow...)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1487" LastEditorUserId="1487" LastEditDate="2011-05-24T13:54:57.907" LastActivityDate="2011-05-31T19:24:07.250" Title="Do Mandatory Bike Lights at Point of Sale Save Lives?"

(pee stops and water refill and otherwise nothing else)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Should I go with the food provided along the way (a supported century), or junk food, or should I prepare my own deal?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;FWIW - 30mi/50k ride does not count. That's a training ride in 2 hours or less. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Update... Here's what it came down to. We used Hammer Nutrition &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hammernutrition.com/products/perpetuem.pp.html?navcat=fuels-energy-drinks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Perpetuem&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, Perpetuem is a bunch of maltodextrin + some protein + some fats. We made up 8 hour water bottles which was basically like slurping down pancake batter. The Century ride had 7 stops along the way. Not counting water refill and pee stops; we only made a real stop for lunch at the 6th stop. The 8th stop was the end, but we continued on for another 30 miles to meet up with our ride back home. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I must add that the Perpetuem mixture started out well, but was extremely revolting by the end of the ride. However, it did the job. Since the May supported century, I've done several 80 - 100+ mile rides. Perpetuem works well as fuel, but I did add some tastier, solid foods to my jersey pocket for a change of pace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user313" LastEditorDisplayName="user313" LastEditDate="2011-09-20T20:44:46.573" LastActivityDate="2011-09-21T15:38:53.397" Title="Multi hour ride nutrition" Tags="&lt;fitness&gt;&lt;nutrition&gt;&lt;distance-riding&gt;" AnswerCount="7" CommentCount="15" />

Like for my recent upgrade when my rear derailleur broke, I replaced with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mtbr.com/cat/drivetrain/derailleur/shimano/xtr-rear-derailler/prd_351013_116crx.aspx&quot;&gt;Shimano XTR&lt;/a&gt; which is pretty neat.

If I only use one brake I would not stop at any junction in time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Could the cause be any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Over greased bearings?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Over greased axle?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;not tightened cone hubs enough?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;not tighted axle enough?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not have any grease on the disk brakes them selves.  Rather nervous getting on the bike now.  Don't seem to be doing too well with this bike home fixing thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;over greased bearings?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Forgot to mention that it is hydraulic disk brakes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in the end I took it to the LBS as I didn't have much confidence in my self at this point.  They had to replace the front pads but where able to clean the rear and cleaned the rotors.  (I had tried to clean the rotors but obviously not vigorously enough).  He said it was a bit of a pain to do.  All is working again.

Though whether or not I really &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a &quot;mountain bike&quot; could be very much up to question, I greatly enjoyed the bicycle regardless.  However, various circumstances have brought me to the point that I'm fairly certain it will cost me nearly as much to replace the bike as it would to get it in good operating condition again.  So, I've junked it and am considering my options for a new one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I did so much like that particular model, my ideal option would be for a brand-new Raleigh M50.  Since no such thing exists this year, I'm looking to you guys to help me find a comparable model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some particular features (pardon if my verbiage isn't quite industry-standard) I liked about the bike included:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Click-shifting, trigger-style gear changers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Finger-tip braking levers&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I'd actually had some trouble adjusting to these at first, with one &quot;learning experience&quot; involving an over-the-handlebars tumble at the end of a hill.  But I eventually grew to really like them.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Front suspension&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I like the shocks in the front, but am quite happy to have none in the rear.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Quick-release seat and wheels&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Water bottle holster&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A minor feature to be sure, but still nice to have.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A really solid-feeling frame&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Added after some research:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mechanical rim brakes:  I have no experience with using or servicing the newer hydraulic or disc brake systems.  I feel that I would trust the mechanical rim braking systems further, since they seem to be much simpler and therefore (I expect) more durable and reliable.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Feel free to politely dispel me of any misconceptions on this point, (I'm happy to learn about the new technologies) but my stance on this in regards to a final purchase decision will not likely change.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some additional points brought up by @zenbike:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Inexpensive, but good quality: A &quot;real&quot; bike, built by a professional, which happens to be cheap.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This was absolutely a big selling point for me.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Off-road capable: Regardless of whether you need or use this option, it feels good.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Commute friendly: Though @zenbike disagrees, I found this bike very enjoyable during my daily commutes, which typically lasted 1/2 hour or more one-way.  I was even pretty comfortable with it on one particular 3.5-hour trip.  But, I think I did purchase a softer seat for it which probably helped.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fun.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My needs when I first bought the M50 weren't too outlandish, but I liked the feeling of versatility and ruggedness the mountain bike gave me.  Though I'd probably never test it to its fullest measure, I felt security in knowing that it could certainly deal with whatever I did put it through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, my daily commute was about 10 miles one-way.  Later, the commute was much longer but mostly done via city bus.  Still, I did occasionally get the wild idea to run the whole 20+ miles on the bicycle myself.  This would all be across your general urban terrain - mostly sidewalks and streets, but occasionally across long stretches of grass (where there was no sidewalk, and riding on the road was just plain insane).  Living in Florida also means that steep inclines are few and far between.  Of course, having grown up here also means that most mole-hills feel like Mount Everest to me when I have to ride up them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, my needs are much simpler.  I'm mostly looking for something to ride alongside my young daughter, but also would like to get back out on my own now and then for a bit of joy riding.  I'll probably be sticking a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more to the sidewalks than I used to, but would still enjoy knowing I can take my bike practically anywhere without much trouble or worry of breaking it.  I'm much more concerned about durability than I am speed or weight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, what do you guys figure?

My bike computer tells me how many calories I have burned.  But it has no cadence meter. The only measurements it has are my weight, distance, instantenous speed, and time (and all information it can derive from that).  Using the GPS on my phone, and the software from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sports-tracker.com&quot;&gt;Sports Tracker&lt;/a&gt; on the same route, I got wildly different results.  The information on sports tracker yielded about 1.5 times more calories burned then on my bike computer.  Now, the GPS has a little more information, like altitude, but the ride was mostly flat. To add to that, there was an elevation drop over the entire route, so I don't know why it would say I burned more calories.  Do these devices use standard formulas, or do they just make stuff up?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it even possible to accurately measure the calories burned?  It seems that even if I had a cadence meter, there would still be a lot of variables.  Wind speed would make a big difference.  If you pedal with the wind at your back on a fixed gear, going 30 km/h, you are going to use a lot less energy pedaling the same bike at the same speed if you are going into the wind.

Disassembling to put the bike in the car, I noticed the small cog was hanging loose and the lockring was gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RIGHT?&lt;/strong&gt; Playing around with the assembly aferwards, it looks like &lt;strong&gt;on top&lt;/strong&gt; is where the spacer should be placed, or at least fits best.  4) Smallest cog engages hub splines as it should; 5) the tabs in the spacer &lt;em&gt;just barely&lt;/em&gt; contact the splines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P4: &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/wsWNs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;P5: &lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/A9Yuj.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sheldonbrown.com/k7.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sheldon Brown&lt;/a&gt; says &quot;Add a 4.5 mm spacer before installing a 7-speed cassette on an 8-, 9-, or 10-speed hub&quot;, which does imply it should go under the cassette, but as my pictures show, ABOVE the cassette seems to make much more sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So am I right and LBS wrong?

This will be our second, and we're planning to build a pair of dedicating touring bikes for this (and other) adventures. We'd like suggestions on how to most cheaply and reliably get our bikes from the United States to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On our previous trip, we ended up having to change carriers, as Delta wanted to charge us a total of $1,600 ($200 per leg per bike, with two bikes and four legs round-trip) to get our bikes back and forth. We switched to Continental, who thankfully only charged an extra $400, but the experience makes us worry about future travel. What we're most worried about is the uncertainty: we may expect the fees to be one amount, but a change in oversize baggage surcharges or a disagreement over the policies with airline personnel could result in us being charged far more than is reasonable. And we may only find this out at checkin, which would be far too late to alter our plans. Thankfully, after getting conflicting information from two Delta staff members over the phone, I confirmed the excessive bicycle surcharge in time to change our flight. Next time, we might not be so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since we've decided to build our bikes, my first thought was to spend the extra money for S&amp;amp;S coupled frames (the awesome &lt;a href=&quot;http://surlybikes.com/frames/trucker_deluxe_frame/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Surly Trucker DeLuxe&lt;/a&gt;) and a matching S&amp;amp;S hard case. This right now seems like the best approach, but it might be annoying with hub dyno powered lights. Two problems come to mind with this approach: 1) I ride a 62cm frame, which still may not fit into a regulation-sized case, and 2) airlines lose baggage all the time. I can't think of a more depressing situation than to wind up in Europe ready to go, with our bikes nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option is to skip the couplers and simply our bikes.

Assuming this is correct, it's not going to have a very big impact, but it might be enough to make it worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know there is an option of using a 3 chainring crankset, but I think that will be a bit too expensive and still won't solve the core issue of getting the right sized large chainring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other option is to change the cassette but I can't see many that would really make much of a difference. If I could get a 15-25 that'd probably be about right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My questions are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Will the change mean I need to change or adjust the front derailler, the rear derailler or  the chain?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Will there be any other impacts I haven't thought of?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Any other ideas to solve the problem?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I can't seem to find a 135mm BCD 50t chainring.

Firstly, one of the lanes is going against traffic.  In this instance, the cars turning left at the intersection have to look behind them to see if bikes are coming from behind. Also, it seems that it would be really difficult to pass another cyclist if the path was busy, since the only way to move around another cyclist is to go into the opposite lane, against the traffic of the other bikes.  The only advantage I can see over regular bike paths is that for the most part you are cut off from the cars.  However, I've never had a problem with cars using &quot;regular&quot; bike lanes. Are there any studies as to how well these lanes work?  Does anybody have any experience with these kids of bike lanes?  How do you like them compared to other types of bike lanes?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of my concern is shown in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.treehugger.com/files/2010/09/awesome-new-two-way-bike-lane-on-prospect-park.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this video (skip to 2:50)&lt;/a&gt;.  The lanes seem to move really slowly, and there seems to be a lot of people in the wrong lane completely.

I'm fairly happy with the setup, since after months of standing outside I just picked up the bike again and started riding without the usual chain maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the problem I currently have is that under large torque, so e.g. accelerating out of traffic lights makes the belt either slip or jump off the rear cog. Riding in traffic with cars close-by makes this a somewhat dangerous mishap, so I'm hoping I could fix this. Even when pedaling with high cadence the belt seems to be moving outwards all the time, and can be fixed by pedaling backwards one round or so. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The instruction manual and &lt;a href=&quot;http://trekdistrict.com/2008/10/belt-tensioning/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;googled resources&lt;/a&gt; claim that setting the correct tension and alignment to be easy, but I've found it to be quite a hard task. So, could someone with more bike mechanics skills and experience tell me how to do this or point me to a good resource? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main questions are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there an easy way to set the tension, without having a special tool for measuring the tension? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How accurate does the tension have to be in order not to slip under pressure?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How can I (easily) align the belt correctly for it not to travel right on the rear cog?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for any answers! I could probably take it to the local shop, but I've been trying to handle all and any maintenance myself, since this is a hobby after all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;==== Edit ====&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't have a picture of my own, but the rear dropouts look like the ones on this picture:&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/YA2ZQ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Trek District Dropout&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've tried to adjust the tension and managed to get rid of the slippage, so the original problem is more or less solved. I've also tried and managed to tighten the belt too much, since it started to have a funny noise and the freewheel didn't seem to work correctly anymore. Now the tension seems about correct, but the belt still &quot;travels right&quot; (as in the image) and jumps off the cog, when accelerating. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm starting to think that the rear hub is not perfectly straight with regards to the belt, but I would think one would notice this when riding. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;=== Edit 2 (2011-08-10) ===&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After nearly getting hit by a bus, caused by the belt jumping off the rear cog, I decided to bite the bullet and take the bike back to the shop. Turns out I have strong fingers, since the problem was too much tension on the belt. The high tension made the rear wheel not fit perfectly in the rear dropouts. This made the wheel just the slightest bit misaligned (what's the opposite of straight?), which in combination with the tension made the belt to travel outwards when applying enough torque. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I got the thing fixed, and it now works as a charm. I'm unable to tell the difference between the earlier too tight belt from the correctly tensioned one, since the difference is very subtle. Thus, the moral of the story has to be that one should use the correct tools for the task at hand. And also that my mechanics skills are not quite as good as I was hoping :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thanks for all the suggestions here, but from now on I suggest all the belt-drive people like me either get the real tools, or support the local bike dealer for the no or low maintenance of the belt drive. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1950" LastEditorUserId="1259" LastEditDate="2012-02-13T05:44:54.907" LastActivityDate="2012-03-07T02:43:41.850" Title="How to measure the correct belt drive tension?"

Obviously helmets had all of the aesthetic appeal of a lycra covered fan-heater back then, however, frame pads were what you had if you really went off road and were serious about your mountain biking. They were not seen as frivolous, just sensible, a bit like a helmet. In the UK nobody would walk out of a bike shop with anything from a brand new Kona Cindercone to a Raleigh Maverick unless it was bedecked with at least one 'Cosmic Trail' frame pad in some garish colour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As well as protecting your nether regions from the bike during an accident they also protected the frame from damage and made it a lot easier to carry the bike up stairs or over a fence. They had their uses on car-racks too. The benefits were undeniable even if the florescent did have a tendency to fade.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, one day, when nobody was looking, they were suddenly removed from the bike shops and made no longer available for purchase. Were they that good that the powers that be in the bike trade had to kill them off, much like GM and the electric car?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why have they not had a continued place in the market place? Given today's 'scratch 'n' snap' carbon frames and the fad for downhill-mountain-biking one would have thought they would be more popular than ever. As it is you only have a few pretend-messengers using them to hide the fact that their bike has got braze ons for the back brake and is not a true fixie.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is an advert for what was the UK's market leader - 'Cosmic Trail'.

It's all crappy. even the high end models. Also, the gears are like new yet. bearings has no imperfections. it's just a matter of lubing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I did open and serviced that freewheel (didn't take pics as I did it overnight alone and was aiming for speed so i could get some sleep).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At first I greased the hell out of it and closed. It spinned as bad as when it was dry and dirty (it has 12yr)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I reopened, cleaned it all again with 90% oil. Applied just enough grease to barely hold the bearings in place for assembly (an invisible film) and right after closing it up again dropped a bunch of 20w-50 engine oil and a bunch of chain-L oil (the snake oil of bike chain lube.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's spinning like new. but after 2-3 weeks, i often get one or another small chain drag when backspinning the pedal very slowly.

Most components would have reasonably well-defined span they will serve, and would probably start falling apart after this many miles, even with reasonable maintenance and repair.

Sometimes boy-racer wannabees have similar sticker collections on their cars but they are rare exceptions, most cars keep the branding simple.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for the interiors, the parts do not have huge supplier names plastered all over them. There are occasional exceptions, 'GTI' models with 'Recaro' seats, forty-year old Porsche cars with 'VDO' dials and that is about the extent of it.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now take a look at your average bicycle. Why is it a rash of tacky logos? Why does every component with the exception of a few generic parts on low-end bikes have to be disfigured by the make with model? This is particularly tedious with the big brands that get their own parts made for them. Why cannot Trek just have their logo on the frame and keep it clean? Why do they have to litter the entire 'finishing kit' with 'Bontrager' logos? It is not as if the average Trek buyer really needs to be reassured that they have 'Bontrager' stickered handlebars every time they look down to change gear. The after market for 'Bontrager' handlebars isn't exactly huge either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So why is it that bikes have to be covered with childish logos everywhere? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1487" LastActivityDate="2011-08-13T09:56:30.500" Title="Why are cycle components so heavily branded?"

My initial rides - a few miles, nothing too extensive yet - revealed that I need to move the handlebars a bit up and back towards the saddle to make my elbows happy; I prefer them to be bent more than they are now. I can think of two ways to do this: Raise the bars or bring them closer in, or a bit of both. (The stem is already at the top of the fork steerer tube, and I'd prefer not to get an extender on this bike.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The drivetrain is a Shimano mountain set I pulled off a hardtail 80's steel-frame mountain bike (upgraded in the noughties), hung on a hardtail 90's Specialized Stumpjumper frame (an aluminum frame with slightly more aggressive geometry). Neither bike had any suspension at all, including the front fork. (Due to my preferences. Suspension is nice, but I dislike the slight loss of feedback.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to know what these changes are likely to do, and, possibly even more importantly, why this is the case. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1: Get a smaller stem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is an easy one, as the existing stem is quite long. Whatever I do, I'll want to bring the bars in. However, I could also look for a stem with a steeper angle while I'm at it. How will these changes affect how the bike handles? Will a shorter stem make the bike more twitchy, or less? (I quite like the way it feels right now.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2: Get some riser bars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a fairly simple way to get the bars closer to me.

Most of my time has been spent researching and sourcing the front wheel. It's a smaller frame which uses a smaller front wheel for shorter women. I learned that many small Terry frames use an ISO 520 24&quot; front wheel so I went hunting around for that. None of my local LBS could source any 520 parts. I found a couple of online retailers that had the 24&quot; road rims (i.e. not 24&quot; BMX rims, typically ISO 507) and tires/tubes. I bought two rims, two tires, and three tubes for future spares.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I built the wheel recently and noticed that the brake reach on the front was about 20 mm more than on the rear wheel, which is a standard 700C (ISO 622). I realize now that the earliest Terry Precision bikes used the even-less-common 600A wheel size, or ISO 540.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Now I'm in a strange situation where I have invested quite a bit into a slightly wrong wheel size. At worst it will sit 20 mm lower in the front and I'll need to find a longer reach caliper brake for the front rim. Is that a problem?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Side question: does anyone know any companies that sell ISO 540 road rims (and tires/tubes)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This whole front wheel situation kinda rags on my otherwise purist Terry restoration so I'm not sure what the best course of action is to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Turns out that ISO 540 is the size of some wheelchair rims today (along with 507). Has anyone ever used a wheelchair rim for their bike? Where can I find one?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P.S. I know these are many questions and that's against SE guidelines, but to be clear, the main question I have is whether or not using my ISO 520 wheel would be a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1364" LastEditorUserId="1364" LastEditDate="2011-08-29T17:01:12.367" LastActivityDate="2013-01-08T01:01:26.867" Title="Terry front wheel (ISO 520 vs 540), big difference?"

This irked me because:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The bike lane was on a busy street, with three lanes of motor vehicle traffic in each direction.  (I was northbound on Embarcadero in San Francisco, for those of you familiar with the city.)  To go around the runner I had to enter the car lanes, which makes me a little uneasy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; wide sidewalk available to runners and other pedestrians along this street.  There were no obstructions on the sidewalk, and it was not choked with other pedestrians.  In other words, there was plenty of room for this runner to run on the sidewalk.  (I'm guessing that he didn't want to run on the concrete sidewalk based on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/health/nutrition/19best.html?_r=3&amp;amp;ref=health&quot;&gt;misguided&lt;/a&gt; belief that the asphalt roadway would be easier on his joints.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So when I was about to pass the runner, I called out, &quot;You're in my lane!&quot;  His reaction was... not positive.

Does North America versus Europe make a difference re. which non-700 wheel size to expect?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The LBS said that frames with/for small wheels were the &quot;mountain bikes&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we bought this ladies bike we wanted it like my other bike, which I like, but smaller: so an aluminium frame with no suspension, and disc brakes; and added a rack, and fenders, an optional pannier ... and a heavy (&quot;Kryptonite New York&quot;) D-lock (I use my bike for year-round commuting). I also got Marathon Plus tires, hoping they'd never flat. Though she could lift the bike on the show-room floor (and when we rented it for a week-end test ride) before they installed those accessories, now that it's heavier she's not comfortable lifting it up and down stairs. What solution?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not for this bike necessarily, but in general: what bike has features and accessories but is proportionally smaller and lighter? Are there specific accessories which may be part of the solution, e.g. by being especially lightweight or removable yet well-made?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This isn't for racing. It's for riding to and around the local parks, and residential roads. Along roads to the park. For shopping. Along flat bike trails next to waterways. Possibly through town or city traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some light-weight bikes are racers, aren't they. But racers are not an ideal ladies bike, I expect. What if a lady has limited upper body strength: I expect (I haven't tried them) that racing drop bars aren't ideal, and complicate learning to brake and shift gears (kindly consider a novice lady rider if you answer this question). Also on a racer, the gearing would be wrong for a novice city/recreational rider.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I say &quot;lady&quot; I mean adult (possible senior) female, wearing pants (trousers) or shorts, height around 5'4&quot; (160 cm) or less, paved roads and paths, non-competitive, novice (and consequently not athletic). I'd like her to ride an hour and enjoy it (assuming e.g. she already does 45 minutes on an indoor bike each day, and swims and walks etc.), and carry it up or down a flight of stairs single-handed, or put it into the back of a van, or onto a rack on front of a bus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People have said and my experience confirms that an LBS might stock only 700-sized bikes, even with the smaller frames. And that where they have a smaller wheel, it's on a mountain bike.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Adding a rack, fenders, and D-lock to an aluminium bike can make it too heavy to lift. Can such accessories be light weight? Apparently a few extra pounds makes a difference, subjectively.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Eyeing specifically light-weight bikes they tend to be racers. Is there a light weight but not a racer (the answer was &quot;apparently not&quot; in the LBS), and if not can one be put together?

I've been riding this on an MTB for 8 years, but I'm looking to upgrade. I recently tried out a 2012 model Specialized Tricross; this having been recommended as a road bike that retains the commuter niceties  (rack/mudguard mounts, etc) and can handle the light gravel tracks that form part of my route.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love the bike, but I found one fundamental problem: The cantilever brakes set off this (initially) terrifying judder under pressure. On one downhill section, I couldn't brake enough to stop accelerating without this vibration running through the whole bike (and me), massively increasing my stopping distance. As a commuter in Oxford, being able to stop quickly and confidently is a must; something I've always been able to maintain with the V-brakes I'm used to. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back at the shop I was told that the judder is something that all CX bikes share, and that it might have been accentuated by the fact I was on a fresh bike on wet roads.  I've also read that softer shoes and toeing in can help reduce the level of vibration, but that nothing can be done to remove it completely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, can anyone point out a way to address this? Is it something I'd simply have to get used to, or have I just picked the wrong kind of bike for my needs?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to 'grivooga' at Reddit (via Cyclo), this is an ideal description of the issue:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What happened is that the fork blades and&#xA;  your headtube flexed. Just a little but enough to change the distance&#xA;  between the brake cable stop and the brake arms. This caused the&#xA;  brakes to pull harder. Something had to give, either the tire will&#xA;  skid, the brake pad will skip, or you'll go over the bars and crash.&#xA;  In this case the brake pad skipped on the rim. That released the&#xA;  pressure momentarily the frame and fork flexed back then the pad&#xA;  caught again and the process repeateded. The whole process happens&#xA;  very quickly, many times a second.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll try one of the recommended fork-mounted hangers, along with some better toe-in and maybe softer compound pads. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For future readers: After a couple of telephone discussions and a short wait, I took it out again with a fork-mounted hangar attached as shown:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/UVMXz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tricross 2012 with Fork Hanger&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The red circle shows roughly where the original hanger was situated.

I was also told that the rear derailleur arm was bent and this was straightened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bike only cost $100 from a reliable friend who only rode it ocassionally and the bike is 3 years old. So the service was &lt;em&gt;comparitively&lt;/em&gt; costly compared to the cost of the whole bike. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the past few days it has started slipping again under load which is what it was doing previously and it won't hold gear at all when in the very lowest 1 1 combination it always slips to 1 2. It is also very noisy when I sit in my average riding gear which is either in 4th or 5th in the rear gears.

While I was warned that play will develop in hubs with adjustable cartridges as the bearings wear over time, I was not prepared for the &lt;em&gt;opposite&lt;/em&gt; problem and thus did not realize what was happening until it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because the left-side cone nut did not seem flush against the spacers and locknut when I took the wheel out, my hypothesis is that &lt;a href=&quot;http://sheldonbrown.com/brandt/left.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;precession forces&lt;/a&gt; turned the cone nut clockwise as the hub turned counter-clockwise. This would have slowly moved the cone nut inward, away from the spacers/locknut. Searching &quot;precession cone nuts&quot; revealed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bikeforums.net/archive/index.php/t-632002.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a relevant thread&lt;/a&gt;, but I did not feel the conversation explored this topic fully.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While there may be flaws in my hypothesis, it does seem like cone nut threading would, as on bottom brackets and pedals, be an important consideration in hub design. Furthermore, while I am aware that axle locknuts should be tightened to prevent cone nuts from loosening, both nuts use a standard right-hand thread. I cannot, therefore, imagine locknuts do a very good job of keeping cone nuts from moving &lt;em&gt;inward&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This brings me to my question. &lt;strong&gt;Why are axle cone nuts on the left side of a bike not reverse threaded?&lt;/strong&gt; If this were the case, it would seem that precession forces would effectively keep cone nuts on &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; sides of the bike flush against their respective spacers and locknuts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2869" LastActivityDate="2012-01-15T13:22:57.687" Title="Why are axle cone nuts on the left side of a bike not reverse threaded?"

This morning, I brought my bicycle to the local service place, and the handyman at the workshop immediately said that it needs replacing, and ordering from The Netherlands (where I indeed bought the bicycle; as a footnote, I am positively surprised that this was the immediate reaction, as responses when I asked advice earlier were along the lines of &quot;I have never seen such a thing before&quot; in response to some part of my bicycle — not many people around here go regularly by bicycle, and I really do hope the people working at the local workshop know what they're doing).

For instance, I use the &quot;hands-off&quot; test to determine the seat's fore/aft; I find it very hard to believe that some &quot;mental condition&quot; could result in me being able to pass the test with a 6 cm -- tip behind BB -- setback one day, then a few days later, I can't pass it unless the seat is 9 cm back!!!  And, yes, I've had several bike fittings.  (It's soon after those that I REALLY went nuts changing things due to the resulting loss in efficiency and/or pain.)  The fitters seem to be confused, too!  The range of their fits includes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;seat height (BB-seat): 81-82 cm&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;seat setback (BB-tip): 5.5-9 cm&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;bar reach (tip-bar): 53-56 cm&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;bar drop: 5-8 cm&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After changing positions, it feels much better for a few rides.  Then, on one ride, the fit suddenly feels so screwed up, its as if I'm on someone else's bike!  I then recheck things, discover something has to be changed by a centimeter or 3.  Then it feels WAY better -- and is usually WAY faster -- until a few days later, when something is obviously wrong . . . and so on, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, any ideas as to why -- besides the mental thing?  Anything to try? If it helps, I'm 6'2&quot; with an inseam of about 36&quot;.  My torso is pretty short, relative to my legs, and I think my thighs are on the short side relative to my lower legs. (Guess I could average out all the fittings, and see how that works.)  I realize I may need a sports psychologist more than a bike fit expert, but I don't have the time or money for that!  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3675" LastActivityDate="2012-03-24T16:46:27.333" Title="Why do I have to keep changing positions?"

This means that the wheel bends&#xA;  to the left more easily than the right. The greater the offset, the weaker the&#xA;  wheel. In order to reduce offset for six-, seven- and eight-speed clusters, hubs&#xA;  have been built with narrower flange spacing. Although they reduce the&#xA;  disparity in tension between left-side and right-side spokes, they weaken the&#xA;  wheel against lateral forces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I'm curious, why is it the standard to do so? Why not center the rim to the hub just like the front, and then offset the frame's drive side rear triangle to accomodate the difference? It may shift the chain line a bit, but this doesn't seem like anything that challenging to adjust for. The strength and durability benefits are huge, and the only downside I can see is that you couldn't arbitrarily change rear hub widths (not that it seems they change that often anyway), or you may have to introduce the offset again.

What physically makes this the case?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From what I understand, 5/6/7/8/9 speed chains all have the same &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; width, 3/32&quot;, and the only difference is the &lt;em&gt;external&lt;/em&gt; width of the chain. Does this also extend through 10/11 speeds as well, or do they have smaller internal widths which would necessitate skinnier chain rings as well? Or is it the case that the external width just keeps shrinking?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IF the difference is only the external width, then it would seem the only compatibility issues would not be in the chainrings themselves, but the spacing in between each one. If it was too small/too wide a chain, the chain would hit the next chainring, and if it was significantly too large the chain may fall in between rings. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it would seem that you could use the same rings with a wider chain (9 speed rings with a 5/6/7/8 speed chain) if you put appropriate spacers between the rings, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://branfordbike.com/itemdetails.cfm?id=808&quot;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;.

I am about to buy a new set of tires for my road bike and am fancying a smaller tire for the front and a wider tire for the rear. Actually Continental offers such tires as a set (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.conti-online.com/generator/www/de/de/continental/fahrrad/themen/rennrad/rennradreifen/gp_attack_force/gpattackforce_de.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GP attack and GP Force&lt;/a&gt;). Also note, that Motorcycles usually have a wider rear tire to support quick acceleration but still have dual disk brakes in the front to maximize brake force.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tend to ride fast in a traffic situation where the majority of bikes travels slower. So I am often underestimated and have to brake sharply. While panic braking my bike tends to pulling, which I have learned to manage. I suspect a wider tire to reduce pulling, by developing more grip in low load situations. The weight balance gets shifted to the front, when breaking sharply and therefore the front tire does not skid even with much break pressure. The back tire on the other hand does only carry little weight and skid with the same brake pressure applied. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am also facing periodical flat tires with a frequency of 1 per 10 weeks or so on the rear tire. I suspect a wider tire to pick up fewer glass splinters, by reducing the pressure. The rear tire carries the main load while non-braked riding and a wider one distributes the force to a bigger surface area thus reducing the pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the input.

Typically the surface is reasonable-quality asphalt; I have a touring bike.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m curious if there are techniques or gadgets to moderate my speed, in order to lessen the need for braking (e.g., in a car one can downshift).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a back-of-the-envelope, computation, consider a 110kg rider/bicycle system coasting down a 7% grade at 50km/hour, or about 13 meters/second. Due to the grade, for every horizontal 13m, s/he descends 0.91m vertically; hence, every second, the potential energy of a 110kg mass dropping 0.91m is added to the bike &amp;amp; rider system and must be removed in order to not accelerate. That potential energy (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy#Local_approximation&quot;&gt;U=mgh&lt;/a&gt;) is roughly 980 joules; i.e., the cyclist must dissipate about 1kW in order to not accelerate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This surprises me; it seems like a lot of energy to be dumping into the environment. But it's on par with what can be produced by racers to reach similar speeds on the flat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I don't know how to compute is how much energy is consumed by air drag, mechanical friction in the bicycle, rolling resistance, etc., to know really what extra a slowing device would need to consume.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing I thought of was a dynamo hub; but those seem to consume less than 5 watts, which would make no real difference.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(I should add that I know I shouldn't brake continuously all the way down.

I took my 5 year old Iron Horse full suspension out to the mountain with some friends that had recently purchased new bikes.  I haven't ridden for a few years so i had to take my bike in for a major tune up before the trip.  My bike was kind of a cheapo ($700) and really could just barely handle the terrain we were riding.  I mean just barely.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We stopped at an enormous bike shop on the way back just for fun, and I was pretty envious of what I saw there.  The technology has come pretty far in 5 years, and if you are willing to put $2000 to $3000 on a bike, you can get a serious machine.  I'm tempted to simply purchase one of these premade bikes, but I hated how I always had to take my old bike in for tune ups because I didn't know how anything on it worked.  This time I want to know the ins and outs of my bike so I can make all the repairs myself.  I've already started a tool kit collection and recently got an awesome repair stand by ParkTool.  I've turned my old MTB into a comfy commuter bike and have had some fun tuning it up myself.  Now its time for my fun bike.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know what I want is basically an all Mountain bike.  Some thing I can tear down rough trails with, but still is useful enough for those long climbs to get to the top those trails.  Here is what I want out of my new bike:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light&lt;/strong&gt;: As light as I can go with a reasonable budget.  I think carbon frames are most likely out.  I'd like to spend less than $2500 for the whole bike.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Durable&lt;/strong&gt;:  I'm a big guy. 220lbs when I'm fit, but 250lbs now. 5'10&quot; tall.

Here are some questions that have been piling up during my search for a frame.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where is the best place to browse a good selection of frames?&lt;/strong&gt;  After some google searching, the only place that had a respectable selection to choose from was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cambriabike.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.cambriabike.com&lt;/a&gt;.  And my god they have a ton of frames, too many for me to figure out actually.  There has to be other places though right?  Most I saw had less than 20 frames, while cambriabike had about 1000. That doesn't make much sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What brands should I be looking for or avoiding?&lt;/strong&gt;  I'm not keen on many bike brands but I do know a few, Cannondale, Kona, Specialized, Iron Horse, Giant.  But I see alot of brands on frames that I've never heard of.  Should I stay away from unknown brands or are there some frame makers out there that are great who just haven't made a name for themselves in full bike assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get a frame with suspension shock already imbedded, or empty full suspension frame and install my own shock?&lt;/strong&gt;  I really would prefer to install my own shock so I can choose the exact one I want.  I'd like to know a little bit about my shock and research it, plus I'd really like to find one that supports remote lockout.  You see it on front forks, but not really on rear shocks.  Anyways, I spoke with a guy at the bike shop and he said shocks had to be specially made for each frame.  That eye-to-eye length had to match just right with compression ratios and yadda yadda yadda.  I think he just wanted to scare me off so I'd buy one of the show room floor. After I get my frame, I should be able to take a look, and buy a freaking shock from Fox Racing or something that fits the bike right?

I would like to stress that they are not &quot;bad&quot; just the knobs have been worn smoother or maybe that makes them bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, I don't use slicks because I do have short portions of several rides that I do which have short stretches of dirt and/or gravel. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4358" LastActivityDate="2012-06-23T07:21:32.917" Title="Rotate or replace tires" Tags="&lt;maintenance&gt;&lt;tire&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="2" />

About an hour and a half into my trek through the woods this morning I noticed that (once again) my left brake lever was hitting my knuckle when I fully compressed it.

These are hydraulic disk brakes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've had this problem before, a few months ago I noticed that I could compress the brake lever almost all the way to my handlebar, which was unusual (this is all with the left lever by the way, my rear brakes are fine). Eventually my front brake lost all power and compressed fully to the handlebar with no resistance.Since I was relatively new to mountain biking I just took it to my LBS and they bled the brake. A few minutes into my next ride the same thing happened. Note that the brake stayed fully functional until I used it. I got that same LBS to bleed the brake again, but alas, my brake lost power again. This time I took it to another bike shop to bleed it for a third time, and it stayed. I had no problems on any future rides.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, on to the problem at hand. When I noticed the problem two days ago (just in my room) I readjusted the position of the lever with a 2mm allen wrench (as stated earlier) and I also decided to reposition the entire mechanism relative to my handlebar so I could get an easier reach and so my wrists would drop more, making going over obstacles easier (saw it on a video on YouTube: &#xD;&#xA;            &lt;div style=&quot;z-index:0;&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;object style=&quot;height: 385px; width: 640px&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                    &lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/kq8sxPXgfx4?version=3&amp;start=0&amp;feature=player_embedded&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                    &lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                    &lt;param name=&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                    &lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;opaque&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                    &lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/kq8sxPXgfx4?version=3&amp;start=0&amp;feature=player_embedded&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; allowScriptAccess=&quot;always&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;385&quot; wmode=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;                &lt;/object&gt;&#xD;&#xA;            &lt;/div&gt;).

My fear of an accident is extreme enough that I am looking into regularly wearing body armor and a full-face helmet just for commuting. When I commuted previously, I felt like I was having near-death experiences on a weekly basis. Anyway, I'd love tips and recommendations on body armor and helmets that could maximize my safety in case of a big crash - especially stuff that comes in womens sizes. I know next to nothing about what is out there and have never done any mountain biking or the kind of sport biking for which people normally use the heavy duty safety gear. Putting on separate knee pads, elbow pads, etc. etc. seems like a huge pain to do twice a day, so I want to find something more like pull-on long-sleeved or short-sleeved top, and ditto for shorts or pants, that has the padding sewn in that I could wear under t-shirts &amp;amp; skort/skirt for summer. And solutions for winter as well. I'd love to get any tips. I'm considering just getting a padded waterproof motorcycle or ski outfit for winter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and on helmet safety - are the skate/multisport helmets like Bern safer or less safe than traditional cycling helmets? Could one of those potentially be a better choice for commuting than a full-face MBX-style helmet?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A little more info about my commute: I live in Washington DC and go about 4.5 miles each way, and it's fairly steep downhill (going) and uphill (coming back). My bike is a very heavy electric assist model. Because of the electric assist, I don't have to worry about overheating as much as on a traditional bike, and I also have much quicker acceleration from a stop. Biking on my route is fairly dangerous, because cars constantly whip around right turns without even looking whether there are pedestrians or cyclists in the way (hence my many near-death experiences). Due to the heaviness of the bike and the speeds I reach going downhill, braking hard can also be dangerous. In addition, I will also be biking throughout the winter when my homeward leg will be in darkness. I was once rear-ended by a cab, and another time I had a braking problem and had a sidelong collision with a car as a result - thankfully no injuries those times, but given past experience I do not want to take any chances of orphaning my daughter!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4643" LastActivityDate="2012-07-28T01:21:53.140" Title="Armor and helmet for ultra-safe commuting (womens size)?"

About 9 months after owning it and riding about 8 kilometres a day 4 days a week it developed a brake squeal at the front - strangely the back brakes have never been a problem and they work really well. &quot;No problem,&quot; I thought, and I cleaned the rim (using a steelo/600grit sandpaper) and toed in the brakes slightly - which fixed it adequately, although temporarily. This process is something I've repeated over the last few years - eventually replacing the worn down pads with a few different styles of cartridge pad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But the squeal has been steadily growing to the point where the I needed stupid amount of toe to stop it - which really just gave me brakes with questionable efficacy. I eventually swapped to a Kool Stop pads - though again this fix was temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being a 700C wheel, I toyed with going to the style of brakes most road bikes have - but I lack the appropriate mounting hole in the front forks - and the tools with which to make one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Noting that there was a reasonable amount of play in the bushes on each brake arm (they're integral to the arm), I bit the bullet and ordered a set of Avid Single Digit 7 brakes, to replace the brakes on the bike. Pulling the old brakes off I noticed the brake bosses on the frame appeared to be bent - so I replaced those too. I cleaned the daylights out of the rim, again with steelo, a quick run over with 600grit sandpaper and an application of automotive brake cleaner to remove any oil (it seems to be a lot cheaper than isopropyl alcohol here and appears to work well - also, I had some close at hand). I also make sure I clean the surface of the pads removing any grit and give them a with once-over with a clean bit of sandpaper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following a number of guides, I installed and set up the new brakes and they are excellent for the most part; the arms are meatier and have far less flex in them and the return adjustment, and adjustment in general, seems to be easier setup and control.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But they still squeal, loudly - in the dry, in the wet, night and day. And granted, terrifying j-walking pedestrians with the noise can be fun - but I don't think it's doing me any favours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So given that I've replaced the brake bosses, the brake arms, the brake pads and removed cleaned, re-greased and refitted the forks - that really only leaves the rim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do I replace the rim, or do I just deal with the squeaking? Or have I missed something really obvious?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An update on my progress.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Replaced the front wheel with a 2nd hand one in excellent condition (having been recently respoked and trued) - some sort of lightweight Ritchey thing. The wheel had been used by a chap who'd commuted a decent distance on it every day and had had no problems with squeal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I cleaned the rim with 600 grit glasspaper, then automotive brake cleaner and a steelo, wiped clean with paper towel. I then cleaned it with methylated spirits and again wiped it clean with a paper towel. This removed all the old traces of brake pad grit and oil and let me check that the surface of the rim was flat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I took off the Avid cartridge pads supplied with the Single Digit 5 brakes and, after cleaning them up with sand paper and a wipe of methylated spirits, put the Koolstop single  compound 'orange' pads back on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adjusted the brakes to make sure they sat on the rim properly (they're slightly thicker than the Avid pads).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And still it squeals!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I'm thinking I just have one of those very resonant frames.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next step is the replace the forks - but I'm in no rush to that anytime soon give the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm still wondering if I've missed something obvious!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="4737" LastEditorUserId="4737" LastEditDate="2012-08-23T08:59:53.037" LastActivityDate="2012-08-23T08:59:53.037" Title="Have replaced v-brakes and they still squeak.

This is for a couple reasons. First of which being I don't actually have my license yet, second being that taking the bus actually takes longer, and third, that I'm getting my exercise AND commuting done at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was initially doing this on a 45lb+ mountain bike with large tires and no pedal clips, but I recently bought a nice $700 road bike and have cut half an hour off the trip so that it only takes about an hour each way. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't so much mind the time it takes, even though it leaves me with little when I get back, as much as I do how tired I get afterwards. At work isn't too bad because I'm sitting most of the time anyway, but after I get home I've spent 8 hours at work, and two hours riding 30 miles on my bike, and I don't have much energy left to enjoy what remains of my time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Diet is, of course, what I'm asking about here. I'm earning a modest pay and trying to put every penny towards college, so I'm not looking to reinvent how I eat, just make some switches or additions here and there. I've tried eating large amounts of pasta the day before, but still didn't see much improvement (I get the feeling I've misunderstood something about carb loading). I would drink more gatorade or other electrolyte-replenishing drinks, but I'm not sure where or how to buy them cheap and in bulk so the cost doesn't add up too much. The other thing I'm concerned about is protein. I'm probably not getting as much of it as I should be, but don't really know what to do about it. I've heard that people who weight train use whey protein - is that something bikers should do as well?

A little background on my riding - I use the cross bike for road/trail commuting, CX racing and general recreation.  I would guess that 30-35% of its' miles are off road, and a good bit of this is on rocky/rooty singletrack.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm a bigger guy also so when I flat it is typically a pinchflat.

While I did this work, I also serviced my rear hub (early 90's 105), replacing the bearings in the cups as the were showing some wear. Initially the shifting action was clean and lovely, the ride significantly smoother. However, about a week later the chain started to skate (that is, ride on top of the teeth) for the middle 3-4 gears on the rear dérailleur. This didn't happen all the time, but it seems to be worse when under stress (crank up grades and such). When trying sort this out, I realized my rear axle had become loose, which was odd, so I tightened it up, and that seemed to sort everything out. It may be worth noting here that my rear cassette shows a bit of swim (that is, side to side wobble as the cassette rotates), sort of the higher end of tolerable, but I wouldn't figure that to be the issue. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, figuring everything is fine, the next day after I changed the tire (routine maintenance, no massive failure, tire was just worn out), the skate was back, though the axle was still reasonably tight. As this is my primary commuting bike, I've ridden it a bit in the week since out of necessity (a handful of gentle miles) and the skate has worsened and it appears the axle is now loose again. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyone have any idea what is going one here?

When I bought it, it was wrapped in plastic, had been stored in the shop's stock house for about 20 years and free of corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm about 95 kilos, thread quite hard but rides exclusive to paved bike paths. The original, 20(?) year-old wheel lasted me a year with no problems. The front wheel is still fine and true. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Spokes breaking - and getting replaced&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a little under a year, I suddenly noticed that a few &lt;a href=&quot;http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/244/terminology-index/13056#13056&quot;&gt;spokes&lt;/a&gt; had broken. On closer inspection, quite a few were too loose. Should have noticed sooner but didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I took it to a shop, where they advised me to have the wheel rebuilt which I paid them to do. The gearing being internal, the new rims and spokes were built on the existing hub.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After just two weeks, the back wheel suddenly began to feel wobbly on my way to work. As careful as I could, I drove the bike back to the shop. Almost all spokes were terribly loose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They retensioned the wheel free of charge (of course) and sent me on my way. The following weeks, I periodically checked that all spokes were still tensioned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2,5 months later, I noticed three of the spokes were broken close to the hub. Went back to the shop and had the spokes replaced (free or charge). 1 month later I noticed 2 broken spokes and had those replace as well. They seemed less eager to keep fixing the wheel free of charge, and when I asked why the spokes kept breaking, the guy muttered something about the hub holes maybe had burrs due to wear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, a few weeks later, I find another spoke broken.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My gut tells me this all stems from a bad build, that quickly lost tension and thus damaged the spokes. I find the explanation about a worn hub a bit far fetched, but I don't have the knowledge to dismiss the theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there any way this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the shop's fault? - A bad build? Cheap spokes? Improperly tensioned?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the wheel's history, is there any point in keep replacing spokes, a couple at a time, or should I get the wheel rebuilt (preferably at the shop's expense)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Could the hub in any way be to blame for this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Update Oct 24th&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've been trying to get in touch with the manager of the shop throughout the week. Failed again to reach him this morning, so I figured I'd have a chat about my problem with one of the guys on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tried to get him to provide at least a theory of why my spokes keep breaking, but not much came out of it really. He mentioned that he've seen, on rare occasaions, that a worn hub could cut the spokes (could be the same guy as I spoke to last time).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll check the hubs as soon as possible, as @Daniel R Hicks suggested. Due to plumbing work in our appartment, I haven't been home or able to check my bike all week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I don't see any indicatations that the spokes were put in the wrong way, I'm going to follow the advice most of you have, and take my bike to another shop for advice and repair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks so far! - I'll update you after I've payed the other shop a visit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Update Nov 3rd&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Took the bike to the other shop, told them the story.

He called her on his friend's cell phone (who also had no helmet or lights or reflectors) and told her to come. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I asked if he was ok or if he hit his head, he said he was fine and didn't hit his head.

There are 6cm of seatpost visible, and I might want to lower an aditional 1cm.&#xA;The main reason I want to somewhat stubbornly keep the frame is that I liked riding it, didn't see any major problem except for a slight touch of the upper seatstays between the thighs, but that tends to disappear since I felt the need to put the saddle a bit more forewards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I am asking is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Even considering the frameset is ridiculously larger than I would&#xA;  typically choose, if I like riding the bike, is there any problem that&#xA;  I'm not considering, a reason NOT to keep the frameset?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm 1,88cm (6'3&quot;) tall, and have used 56cm bikes, this one is 64cm (seat tube, bbc to top).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any insight!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/2yTiC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2355" LastEditorUserId="2355" LastEditDate="2012-12-01T00:53:55.090" LastActivityDate="2013-06-03T04:37:57.223" Title="How can I tell if a bike is too big for me?"

I searched online and found out it's called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presta_valve&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Presta valve&lt;/a&gt;, and it's pretty common and popular. I'm finding it annoying and fiddly and don't know how to use it properly. I have a floor pump, and I know the valves and pump are fine, because the guy in the shop had no trouble using the same one. But after reading online and watching YouTube videos I still can't figure out how to do it properly!  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's what I'm trying:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rotate wheel so that the pump can comfortably reach the valve (guides online say the valve should be at 12 o'clock position, but I can't do that because the hose on the pump isn't long enough)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remove valve cap, unscrew thingy in valve, and tap it a little - a jet of air shoots out. OK.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Push pump onto valve. This is where I get into trouble...&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can't seem to get the attachment onto the valve in the right way. I'm pushing it on with the elbow lever thingy down, and then pulling the lever up as you can see in the pictures, to make the attachment grip onto the valve.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, either it flops around loose and leaks air out the sides (when I push it on gently), or sometimes it goes on but then the tire doesn't seem to inflate any, the pump just gets stiff really quickly as if the valve was blocked - then I remove the attachment and it goes pffffft like all the pressure was just backed up in the hose and not actually going into the tire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was able to pump up the tire eventually, but it took me about an hour of stuffing around and my &quot;project manager&quot; got angry, because I was supposed to be in the kitchen making her a salad, not mucking around in the garage.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The time I got it on properly I had to deflate the tire completely, and even then it was difficult because with the tire completely deflated the stem of the valve just pushed into the rim. Surely this is not normal? What's the trick of attaching the darned thing?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, how can I just check the pressure? When I attach the thing I expect the guage to jump up and show me what pressure it's at, but it just stays at 0.

The driver did too. He yelled, &quot;Your bike!&quot; and opened the door for me, I dropped my stuff and took off after the thief.

I was told it wasn't worth re-truing the rear wheel so I bought a cheapo Raleigh wheel from the LBS. I also bought a new 7-speed freewheel and Shimano derailer which I managed to install myself (using the original chain) and has been working great for about a year now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bike is nice to ride but I wouldn't mind upgrading the wheelset to a lighter and better set that would help with climbs and longer tours.

Being a steel frame I am fairly confident i can just squeeze a 130mm wheel in there but my concern is the cassette size and chain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am under the impression that an 8-speed cassette uses a narrower chain.

Sheldon says it should be possible but there may be a few issues.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Derailleur is modern so should hopefully take whatever chain is used.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Friction shifters mean no worries about indexing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I would like to stick to a 7-speed cassette. Reasons: I doubt my shifters can do more than 7 (bike was originally a 6-speed); I assume this will help maintain chain compatibility between front chainrings and cassette. Am I wrong?

I loved it from the start!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, I was feeling like I was my saddle got suddenly too low.&#xA;Probably I was pedaling too much &quot;with my heels&quot; when riding flat (which maybe explains even more how the performance gain is spectacular).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have considered the saddle height from a few different perspectives:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I moved my saddle up and it felt way better while riding.&#xA;Still, at the height where it &quot;feels&quot; the best, my knee is slightly bent which seems fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the general rule-of-thumb of having the barefoot heel just touch the pedal with the leg completely straight when the pedal is completely down, my barefoot foot is a little under an inch hovering over the pedal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know that Master Sheldon also stated another rule-of-thumb being that the proper saddle height is: the highest possible without wobbling the hips down to reach for pedals.

I only really started serious night-riding this winter, and pretty soon found that the headlight I already had (a Cateye running on 4xAA batteries and rated at 2200 candela) was fine for the city but not for dark country roads. So I started looking for a brighter headlamp and found that Cateye did a newer model, again running on 4xAA batteries but rated at approx. 4000 candela. I bought one and the light was not brilliant but certainly acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That was just 2 months ago, and on my ride home last night the front of this light just fell out. Fortunately I was carrying a spare but when I got home was unable to fix the new light. Possibly there was another part that got left on the road… Anyway, this is going back for a refund, and I need to start looking for a different headlight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My requirements are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Brightness: at least as bright as the light I’m replacing, although I see that higher-spec lights are specc’d in terms of lumens, not candela, so they are measuring slightly different things. But I am minded to go for something suitable for trail riding, even though I will be using it on a road bike, because the better the view I have of the road (and of the potholes) the safer my ride will be.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Battery life: will need at least 3 hours between charges, running at full power. Preferably more. My actual commute is normally around 90 mins per day, and I want to build some resilience against (a) unforeseen delays, and (b) forgetting to charge the light every night.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Size/Portability: I want to be able to put the light on one bike, to get it off in a matter of seconds, to be able to stuff it into my pocket while I’m on the train, and to then use it on another bike when I get off the train. I’d be happy to buy multiple brackets if necessary (which is what I did with the cateye).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ruggedness: I don’t mind spending money on a headlight but I don’t want it falling apart after two months like the last one. I want something that’ll be good for a couple of years at least.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mounting: I'm only interested in something I can put on the handlebars. (I already have a light on my helmet and like to ride with both sets.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and a preference is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;that it runs on AA batteries. This is probably the most awkward thing, and I realise that most of the better headlights run on their own rechargeable batteries, so I may have to sacrifice this one. The reason for wanting this is twofold: First, my rear light runs on AA batteries so in terms of keeping spares in my saddlebag, I only need one variety of battery. Second, I find standard battery sizes reassuring because if push came to shove, I can walk into a shop and buy replacements on the spot.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other things…..my budget is quite open. I’m quite happy to spend a few hundred (GBP). Obviously, the cheaper the better since ideally I will buy two of them, but by the same token I don’t want to sacrifice quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I guess my question at the end of all this is whether anybody had any suggestions for me? I know I can google to death, and read reviews all over the web, so I don't need peoples' help there. What would be good are answers based on peoples’ real world experience gained over a period of time. The kind of stuff that I'm not likely to see based on the short test e.g. Bikeradar would have performed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyone got any advice? TIA&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update #1 (decided what to buy)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end I have sacrificed the AA aspect and today ordered a Niterider Pro 1800 headlight. This was the best my budget would allow and I figure I will be able to run it on med or even low to get the kind of runtimes I'd like. I bought it from a UK dealer - if I were based in the USA I would certainly have given the DiNotte lights more consideration.

Seems very well built overall. Battery was a little larger and a little heavier than expected, but not uncomfortably so and not noticed once strapped onto the top tube. Certainly worth it if I can squeeze 6 hours out. Minor issue was the velcro fastener rubbing against my tights, will need to watch that because those tights were expensive! But this will just be fine tuning.

I think the 120 is magnetic but don't know about the 140. Those problems seem worse to me than the Sunny issue but since I'm buying it to AVOID noise and prefer magnetic resistance, it ends up making this a toughy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately no place nearby has any bikes for me to try so I'm flying blind.

The old chain was a Shimano 9 speed that I installed 18 months and about 5000 miles ago.  It had stretched modestly and was full of winter cruft/grime.  The new chain is a SRAM 9 speed, my first time using the gold snap ring system.  I followed instructions and made sure I have the same link count as the chain that came off the bike.  The cassette was new with the old chain, so it has about 5000 miles on it and doesn't appear to have significant wear.  After installation and a clean/wipe/lube/wipe, I took it for a 15 mile easy ride at about 15-16 mph.  It shifts perfectly and I didn't have to make any adjustments to either derailleur.  Three times, however, when putting it under stain (once on a modest hill climb, once starting from a stop sign in a fairly big gear, and once on an acceleration coming out of a sharp turn) it skipped several teeth and caused my foot to slam down hard.  On the hill, it actually hurt as I had my weight off the saddle (not really standing) and I came down hard on the inside of my thigh.  I think all three were on the right side (power train side) pedal stroke, and I don't think they were all in the same gear.  I'm pretty sure it was the rear cassette that skipped, not the front chainring, but it did happen really fast each time.  I will also say that it's not like these were the only three times I put substantial pressure on the pedals in the ride - I wasn't going hard, but I wasn't being tentative or anything.

Will thinner tires (optimally inflated) reduce or increase the percieved resistance?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or do you think I've just been riding with too low pressure all the time, and the current tire size is fine? If thicker really = faster at optimal pressure as they say, maybe the thicker tires also tempt people to use not enough pressure? Otherwise I can't explain my gut experience that the thick tires feel slow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5661" LastActivityDate="2013-04-07T02:29:45.677" Title="Tires for 28' city bike (622x19C) to reduce rolling resistance?"

That has made my drivetrain to get out of tune and drop the chain frequently, even I if adjust it before every ride. I am discarding here my shifting technique as a source of problems because I know how to shift correctly. I thus want to know at which level of the groupset hierarchies (no matter if it is Shimano or SRAM) this is less frequent. That is, that you adjust the gears and they stay adjusted for more than a ride even after some abuse. If I am going to need to adjust the gears every time no matter if the group is a XTR or a Acera, well, then I will rather save my money. But if XTR is stronger and stays tuned for more time, then I don't mind paying for the quality. I would like to hear from experienced riders if they noticed (or didn't) a great improvement in reliability (not weight or coolness-factor) when they bought a more expensive groupset.

It has always worked quite well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; the fork is a &quot;Merida M-510, 100 mm, LO&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mbike.ru/bikes2005/matts_miami.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;This looks like it&lt;/a&gt;) - although google finds nothing on that, so I guess its a rebranded something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my question - what's likely happened to the forks? Is it something I can fix (and how?)? Is it likely to be a manufacturing defect? And of course, does locking for a long time (even if unused for most of that time) cause issues?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: I've read the questions on here about fork maintenance; none of them mention locking for prolonged periods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6889" LastActivityDate="2013-05-30T12:48:46.403" Title="Suspension fork - Can you leave them locked for a long time?"

This is the second time the exact thing happened. Both times rear, both times after repairing tube. I don't know how old the tubes were, but the second one seems pretty new and the rubber is still very pliable. I tend to overinflate since the roads near me are full of hazards. This time I did not take too much care in seating the tube, but the first time i was very careful and slightly inflated, massaged the tire to make sure there were no folds or twists, and then deflated and inflated. I use a hand pump, and really don't know the pressure but I assume the tire would take any stress from high pressure, and the tube would just be sandwiched in there so high pressure would be no problem. Today was not hot (about 22C), but the sun was on the bike.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OK, here's the twist -- not sure if it matters. The tires are 16x1 3/8 BE, that is an old Japanese standard used on old commercial bikes. (believe it or not, it is my daily ride and I take the beast into the mountains (no gears) 2 or 3 times a week.) The tires have ears that go under the tube and overlap protecting the tube from the spoke ends. They are a pain to change, and although you can not see the tube as you seat the tire, you have to check the tire to make sure the ears are straight and not folded and the tube is not pinched, so this system should not make the tube explode in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Question -- anyone ever have tubes explode in the sun? Any idea what could cause this? Anyone know what happens if the tube is folded funny in tire -- can it form a bubble that is under too much stress? Is there something I can do to prevent this happening a third time? (three times, it's enemy action.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Update --  (1) I buy the tubes on the net and don't think the stock is old. These delivery bikes were very common in Japan so they are still selling the tubes but not so much locally. (2) no rim strips - the tire becomes the rim strip i will try to attach photo of a tire below. (3) I don't assume the tire will take any pressure, but I assume the &lt;em&gt;tube&lt;/em&gt;, when constrained inside the tire will. (4) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raleigh.jp/InfoFAQ/060701_wheel-adv.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.raleigh.jp/InfoFAQ/060701_wheel-adv.htm&lt;/a&gt; shows a cutaway of the tire system on at the bottom of the page on the right (with &quot;B/E&quot; above the drawing.) (sorry about the Japanese.) You can see the tire is about as thick under the tube as it is on the tread. That is the &quot;ears&quot; i mention above. This also makes it very hard for tire to come off rim, as the pressure of the tube is forcing the bead into the groove. I think D.R Hicks' comment may be a clue, but I can't see how tire could unseat with this system. I did not see it happen, but afterward the tire was slightly unseated at the spot of the gash, but when the pressure is gone it is hard to tell with this system. Again, the pressure hold everything in place. (5) the gash (both times) was at about the 4:00, with the valve stem at 6:00 position.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Update 2 -- here is a photo of a typical B/E tire. (Sorry I can not post photos yet.)  &lt;a href=&quot;http://urekko-cycle.shop-pro.jp/?pid=15948577&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://urekko-cycle.shop-pro.jp/?pid=15948577&lt;/a&gt;    The white parts go under the tube. They are white (i think) so you can tell that they are not folded during assembly - this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a white wall tire. To assemble, you have to put one side on, make sure the ear is laying flat and goes all the way under the tube from bead to bead, then insert the tube and do the same for the other side making sure tube is not poking through. when assembled the white is completely under the tube. You also have to notch the ears for the valve stem to poke through before you use. They used to sell a special tool, but I use an exacto. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Update 3 -- Sorry if i am being wordy. These tires/rims were very common in Japan until about 10 years ago. Almost all delivery bikes used this system and many of the bikes are still out there. My guess is that they used this type of rim from the 60's until around 2000 on most delivery bikes, and some high end mama-chari's. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Update - Final answer --&#xA;I think @Daniel and @mattnz are correct and the tire must be coming off the rim. I initially discounted this, since the B/E system makes it seem impossible, but now I am convinced this is the case. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tire is slipping off the rim at the valve stem because the ears have the notch for the stem and this is a weak point. My guess is that the sun is making the rubber soft and more pliable and the top ear is able to slip past the tube and bottom ear to unseat the bead. This seems unlikely, as the tube pressure is holding the three pieces together, but it is the only possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I researched in Japanese about B/E blowouts, but could not find anything. This is why I initially thought the tube was pinched or folded somehow and in that case it would be potentially a problem for any tire, but now I think the problem is unique to B/E rims.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The solution I will try, is to clean off the rubber and rim really well so that the four layers (rim, ear, ear, tube) all grip when under pressure. This is the opposite of what I planned to do before the discussion, as I thought some talc might help a tube kink straighten out. I may even put a dab of rubber cement between the ears near the valve stem. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many thanks for the Help&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6903" LastEditorUserId="6903" LastEditDate="2013-05-13T04:43:51.727" LastActivityDate="2013-05-14T12:47:54.910" Title="exploding inner tubes" Tags="&lt;tire&gt;&lt;innertube&gt;" AnswerCount="3" CommentCount="12" ClosedDate="2013-05-17T19:16:22.600" />

So I disassembled my front hub.  Everything looked good until I got to the cones.  One has a rather noticeable line worn by the balls (more so than I've seen on other bearings), and the other has what I would call a spalled spot in addition to the line, with a rough, wavy area for maybe 15 degrees of arc.  The cups, on the other hand, look factory fresh.  This is a Shimano RSX hub.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any idea what would cause this?  The hub has 25-30K miles on it, but has been overhauled twice.  The sound came up over a period of maybe 100-200 miles riding.  I don't go off-road and I don't jump curbs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, since the cups look good and the rim probably still has another 10-20K of life left, I'm thinking of getting a new hub and just swapping the cones, vs replacing the hub or buying a new wheel.  Any reason not to do this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More info&lt;/strong&gt;:  I took a closer look at the cones.  One is not really that worn -- there's just a barely-perceptible mark from the balls, and I'd not suspect it at all if it weren't for the other cone.  The other is spalled to one degree or another all around, however.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, oddly, the two cones are not identical.  The &quot;good&quot; one has the plastic seal washers, while the &quot;bad&quot; one has no groove for seal washers.  Clearly, one or the other (probably the &quot;bad&quot; one) has been replaced in one of the two bike shop overhalls.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the question is, why was the old cone replaced?  Presumably it was spalled as well, so what could be causing one cone to spall?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven't removed the dust caps, so I can't get a REAL good look at the cups, but will have a shot at it again, using a flashlight.  But on my several inspections so far the cups look smooth and shiny.  And I'm certain the balls were replaced the last time around.  (Unfortunately, inspecting 18 tiny ball bearings is just about impossible.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are pictures:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/udFmj.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/MCunc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my camera only does a middling job with macro photography.  In the first shot the bad cone is on the left and the good (stock Shimano) one is on the right.  The second shot is the bad cone removed from the axle.  The line you can see, up close, looks kind of like a bead of weld, with &quot;puddling&quot; -- little dents kind of pushed up against each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I went to remove the cone I discovered that it was very difficult to remove.  Something had snarled the threads on the axle, at about the junction point between the cone and the lock nut.  It was impossible to say with any certainty, but it looked like the axle was very slightly bent at that point.  It may be that a bent axle was the cause of the failure (though I don't know how it would have gotten bent, or how a bend at that point could cause a bearing failure).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, swapped in the axle from a new hub (also replaced the balls and repacked it) and the noise seems to be gone (though hard to tell for sure, as it was so windy for my test ride).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grrr!!!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The noise is back, with the new axle, cones, and balls.  Have not taken it apart yet, but I'm guessing one of the cones will be pitted when I do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And looking for a new wheel, I can't find anything on the internet.  It's a Shimano HB-A410 hub, Mavic 622x18 rims, 36 hole.

I didn't have any specific tools and the press-fit went in by firm hand pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on to the BB and crank.  The old bike was running SRAM Rival and SRAM GXP cranks.  New frame came with Shimano press-fit BB already fitted (I believe to be Shimano SM-BB91-41B).  From a lot of internet searching it was still unclear whether the BB is compatible with GPX crank so I gave it a go to see.  Once fitted it actually seemed fine but after a short test ride there was a bit of play that no tightening could get rid of.  I left it for a week then went back to it to remove when I had a spare 5 minutes......  Oh dear, in my rush I forgot that to remove I need to leave the outer 'screw' in and loosen the inner one to push the crank arm off.  Instead I screwed a crankpuller in to the crankarm and kept tigntening and managed to strip it.

I was fairly savvy on the equipment of the day. It's changed quite a bit. This is the question I put to BikesDirect:&#xA;I need some help picking a bike. I began serious biking in 1984-85 and became very serious &quot;touring bike&quot; rider. I last owned a Trek and for various reasons I have not biked since that time.&#xA;I always had problems with pinch-flats but MTB bikes of the time simply weren't made for distance riding. Now days I have put on weight 6'2&quot; 255-270 lbs. From my reading I've decided a Hardtail 29er&#xA;might best suit me. Something I can put a rather tight nob tubeless kevlar tire with a large footprint and 120TPI or higher. I thought only front fork suspension with my weight. Perhaps 30-spd with heavy duty&#xA;derailleur and hvy duty crankset. The new very good hydraulic brakes seemed ideal. The area where I am ignorant is in frames . . . It seems AL remains the best choice (cost-effective) among materials but there are so many types or configurations with different types of buttressing joints --- Please help with what ya'll think are the top choices and if you agree with my choice of a &quot;29er Hardtail&quot; as well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was thinking of spending $500 - $700 but would go for $1000 if the ideal bike stood out.  Also as a closing thought, I became attached to toe-clips and wonder what the current thought on their use is Their Answer:Are you going to be trail riding or pavement riding?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you can have just one bike, make it a Motobecane Elite Sport/Trail/Adventure Dual Sport model...It's the perfect choice for the rider who wants a bike that’s fast on the road, capable of spirited off-road excursions, and ready for everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/motobecane/elite_adventure_x5.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/motobecane/elite_adventure_x5.htm&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;So, what do you think of this equipment choice and how does it compare to the bike I found on BikeShopWarehouse for $299.00?

While the calipers are installed on the bike, with everything tightened, I can move (rotate) the calipers side to side with my hand.

Tightening that front nut only seems to add friction between the callipers. So, for example, when I release the brakes, the callipers do not return to their original position. Tightening that piece of metal in the rear seems to make it more difficult for the callipers to move (rotate). I’ve tightened these rear pieces as much as I could.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if these brakes have been assembled correctly. One had 2 washers between that front nut and the calipers, the other one didn’t. Are washers even necessary?

Why is it a problem?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's a problem because they get off center as you brake. You get one brake pad rubbing against the rim as you release the brakes. So in other words, they don't retract evenly. Ideally, I would want the brake calipers to be an even, fixed, distance from the rim (not loose).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I thought maybe it was an issue of friction. I disassembled one and greased it. I also put lube on the inside of the cable housing. This didn't help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What might also be a problem is the length of the cable housing. In the front, the housing definitely causes the calipers to tend to one side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It might also be an issue of unequal tension in the spring.

There are no markings, and of course, no documentation of any kind. I assume 700 means 700mm, so 700 / 25.4 = 27.56 inches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I measure the rim however, its diameter is approximately 25.1 inches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I buy Continental tires, the size is 28 inch, but I have to buy 27 inch Bontrager tubes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, per this link, tires come in sizes of 26, 27, and 28 inch, and size 700. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schwalbetires.com/bike_tires/road_tires/marathon_420&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.schwalbetires.com/bike_tires/road_tires/marathon_420&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How can I determine my wheel size, and are these various sizes interchangable. Also, is the 'C' suffix important, and what does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course the tires are marked, but I am under the impression (per the dealers comments) that Continental marks their tires differently than everyone else. Also, the tire markings don't help for ordering a new wheel. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With so many tire sizes available, how can I know if I am using the correct size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After reading the various answers here, I should explain that my confusion on this matter stemmed from the fact that I used to work as an auto mechanic. In the auto industry, car tires are based on wheel size, 13&quot;, 14&quot;, 15&quot; etc, and there is no possible way to mount a 15&quot; tire on a 13&quot; rim for example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So when I saw all these different tire sizes, I assumed they all required a different wheel size, but in fact, there is essentially just one wheel diameter for my type of bike, which they refer to as 700C, which is actually 622mm. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also initially assumed that the C referred to the wheel's width, but that isn't true either. The C is apparently just antiquated terminology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So at least in theory, I can mount a 26&quot;, 27&quot; 28&quot; or 29&quot; tire on my 700C (622mm) rim. I just need to verify the width of the tire is suitable my wheel width, which is what Sheldon Brown's article explains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, I measured my Continental tires, which are marked as 28 inch. They actually measure 27 inches (fully inflated), which must be why my dealer calls their sizing non standard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7875" LastEditorUserId="7875" LastEditDate="2013-08-26T10:25:56.153" LastActivityDate="2013-08-26T10:25:56.153" Title="How do I determine my wheel size" Tags="&lt;tire&gt;&lt;wheels&gt;&lt;repair&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="8" />

The front brake lever was squishier than the rear. After skidding out and landing my hip on a stump, which lowered morale significantly for the next half-hour or so, I learned to give the front brake a harder squeeze to compensate for the squish. This was on a mountain trail and at the urging of my biking companion on that day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my question is this: How does one brake under certain circumstances?

It has a standard square-taper BB with a double chainring chainset. I can see the chainrings are removable from the spider and was thinking I could just remove them and replace with a singlespeed ring to save having to buy a whole new crankset.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Will this work or will I have problems with chainline? I have yet to buy a new rear wheel with singlespeed hub so it's quite hard to check if chainline will work. I presume it is possible to bolt the chainring to either side of the spider giving me a choice of two positions. Beyond this I'm not sure how I would adjust chainline if it's out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any general help/tips regarding conversion appreciated.
