Did the front without much of a problem, (reused the existing bearings at the moment, had not got round to going to the LBS to get new ones).  I tried to do the rear wheel tonight. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I got the wheel off, took the quick release out.  undid one side of the axle (disk brake side I believe), took out the bearings etc.  I noticed that a few of the bearings from the cassette side had fallen out while taking the other side off. I then used the chain whip and other bit thing (who's name I can not remember) to eventually undo the cassette (was on real tight).  Took everything apart (trying to remember the order, even placing things in rows of where it came from) and cleaned it all up.  Went to put it back together again and I can not figure out at all (not with any confidence) how the bearings go into the cassette side under the locking nut (think its called that, the bit that comes off with the chain whip and tool).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are all the bits and the wheel.

Most of my time has been spent researching and sourcing the front wheel. It's a smaller frame which uses a smaller front wheel for shorter women. I learned that many small Terry frames use an ISO 520 24&quot; front wheel so I went hunting around for that. None of my local LBS could source any 520 parts. I found a couple of online retailers that had the 24&quot; road rims (i.e. not 24&quot; BMX rims, typically ISO 507) and tires/tubes. I bought two rims, two tires, and three tubes for future spares.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I built the wheel recently and noticed that the brake reach on the front was about 20 mm more than on the rear wheel, which is a standard 700C (ISO 622). I realize now that the earliest Terry Precision bikes used the even-less-common 600A wheel size, or ISO 540.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Now I'm in a strange situation where I have invested quite a bit into a slightly wrong wheel size. At worst it will sit 20 mm lower in the front and I'll need to find a longer reach caliper brake for the front rim. Is that a problem?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Side question: does anyone know any companies that sell ISO 540 road rims (and tires/tubes)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This whole front wheel situation kinda rags on my otherwise purist Terry restoration so I'm not sure what the best course of action is to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Turns out that ISO 540 is the size of some wheelchair rims today (along with 507).

This means that the wheel bends&#xA;  to the left more easily than the right. The greater the offset, the weaker the&#xA;  wheel. In order to reduce offset for six-, seven- and eight-speed clusters, hubs&#xA;  have been built with narrower flange spacing. Although they reduce the&#xA;  disparity in tension between left-side and right-side spokes, they weaken the&#xA;  wheel against lateral forces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I'm curious, why is it the standard to do so? Why not center the rim to the hub just like the front, and then offset the frame's drive side rear triangle to accomodate the difference? It may shift the chain line a bit, but this doesn't seem like anything that challenging to adjust for. The strength and durability benefits are huge, and the only downside I can see is that you couldn't arbitrarily change rear hub widths (not that it seems they change that often anyway), or you may have to introduce the offset again. Why don't bicycle manufacturers start doing this instead? Do they make frames that you can use a rear wheel built with the rim centered on the rear hub?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rear Wheel Offset --&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_12U2yyNOfC8/SVBBbkrTChI/AAAAAAAAACk/qws7HSe5ZUA/s400/offset.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rear Wheel Offset&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3777" LastActivityDate="2012-10-27T22:02:07.430" Title="Why offset the rear rim to the hub and not the hub in the frame?"

Currently, if you want to use a non-standard pattern, you have to run the length computations a number of times; for example, in a 3-spoke crow's foot, you'd have to compute the lengths for a radial spoking, and then again for 2x). Also, some patterns are manufacturer specific or rare and there don't exist calculators for them (G3, Paired, Twin Pair, etc.). I'd like to simplify this calculation and account for non-standard spoking patterns as well as the regular ones, however I'm not sure what patterns are out there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To limit the question some, I'm only concerned with &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;lacing patterns&lt;/strong&gt; - a term I'll have to define:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It has to make a working, rideable wheel. Some spokes must oppose the tension of other spokes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The number of leading spokes is equal to the number of trailing spokes (both 0 for radial). I realize they could just be placed randomly to make a wheel, but this isn't a &lt;em&gt;pattern&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unless there's a reason for it&lt;/em&gt; (or someone's done it before), every leading spoke should be matched equally to a trailing spoke. Sure, the leading spokes could be 1x and the trailing 3x, but why do this?

When I bought it, it was wrapped in plastic, had been stored in the shop's stock house for about 20 years and free of corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm about 95 kilos, thread quite hard but rides exclusive to paved bike paths. The original, 20(?) year-old wheel lasted me a year with no problems. The front wheel is still fine and true. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Spokes breaking - and getting replaced&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a little under a year, I suddenly noticed that a few &lt;a href=&quot;http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/244/terminology-index/13056#13056&quot;&gt;spokes&lt;/a&gt; had broken. On closer inspection, quite a few were too loose. Should have noticed sooner but didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I took it to a shop, where they advised me to have the wheel rebuilt which I paid them to do. The gearing being internal, the new rims and spokes were built on the existing hub.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After just two weeks, the back wheel suddenly began to feel wobbly on my way to work. As careful as I could, I drove the bike back to the shop. Almost all spokes were terribly loose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They retensioned the wheel free of charge (of course) and sent me on my way. The following weeks, I periodically checked that all spokes were still tensioned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2,5 months later, I noticed three of the spokes were broken close to the hub. Went back to the shop and had the spokes replaced (free or charge). 1 month later I noticed 2 broken spokes and had those replace as well. They seemed less eager to keep fixing the wheel free of charge, and when I asked why the spokes kept breaking, the guy muttered something about the hub holes maybe had burrs due to wear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, a few weeks later, I find another spoke broken.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My gut tells me this all stems from a bad build, that quickly lost tension and thus damaged the spokes. I find the explanation about a worn hub a bit far fetched, but I don't have the knowledge to dismiss the theory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Questions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is there any way this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the shop's fault? - A bad build? Cheap spokes? Improperly tensioned?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the wheel's history, is there any point in keep replacing spokes, a couple at a time, or should I get the wheel rebuilt (preferably at the shop's expense)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Could the hub in any way be to blame for this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Update Oct 24th&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've been trying to get in touch with the manager of the shop throughout the week. Failed again to reach him this morning, so I figured I'd have a chat about my problem with one of the guys on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tried to get him to provide at least a theory of why my spokes keep breaking, but not much came out of it really. He mentioned that he've seen, on rare occasaions, that a worn hub could cut the spokes (could be the same guy as I spoke to last time).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'll check the hubs as soon as possible, as @Daniel R Hicks suggested. Due to plumbing work in our appartment, I haven't been home or able to check my bike all week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I don't see any indicatations that the spokes were put in the wrong way, I'm going to follow the advice most of you have, and take my bike to another shop for advice and repair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks so far! - I'll update you after I've payed the other shop a visit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Update Nov 3rd&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Took the bike to the other shop, told them the story.

I was told it wasn't worth re-truing the rear wheel so I bought a cheapo Raleigh wheel from the LBS. I also bought a new 7-speed freewheel and Shimano derailer which I managed to install myself (using the original chain) and has been working great for about a year now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bike is nice to ride but I wouldn't mind upgrading the wheelset to a lighter and better set that would help with climbs and longer tours.

Being a steel frame I am fairly confident i can just squeeze a 130mm wheel in there but my concern is the cassette size and chain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am under the impression that an 8-speed cassette uses a narrower chain.

Sheldon says it should be possible but there may be a few issues.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Derailleur is modern so should hopefully take whatever chain is used.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Friction shifters mean no worries about indexing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I would like to stick to a 7-speed cassette. Reasons: I doubt my shifters can do more than 7 (bike was originally a 6-speed); I assume this will help maintain chain compatibility between front chainrings and cassette. Am I wrong? Would the 7-speed cassette linked above need a spacer or would it just work out-the-box?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the moment it seems like it should be OK.

However, I do like to do my own maintenance where I can, so was thinking about what tools I would need to be able to do the job myself in future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking I would need a spoke wrench, a truing stand and a spoke tension meter. But would I need anything else? Or are any of these items unnecessary?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a follow on question, this was a spoke on the drive side of a rear wheel that was bought just 9 months ago as part of a new (and expensive) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ffwdwheels.com/products/wheels/road-carbon-alloy-clincher/f6r-c-dt240/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;wheelset&lt;/a&gt;, and has done something like 1500km so far.

Thanks to all three respondents, every answer was good - a spoke wrench was the only tool required. I estimated the correct tension by plucking the spokes and made sure the wheel was approximately true just using the frame.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only other thing to note was that, having decided to replace the spoke like-for-like, the particular spoke was very difficult to get hold of singly. In the end I ordered from an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wheelbuilder.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;online shop&lt;/a&gt; in the US (I'm in the UK).

I began serious biking in 1984-85 and became very serious &quot;touring bike&quot; rider. I last owned a Trek and for various reasons I have not biked since that time.&#xA;I always had problems with pinch-flats but MTB bikes of the time simply weren't made for distance riding.

Something I can put a rather tight nob tubeless kevlar tire with a large footprint and 120TPI or higher. I thought only front fork suspension with my weight. Perhaps 30-spd with heavy duty&#xA;derailleur and hvy duty crankset. The new very good hydraulic brakes seemed ideal. The area where I am ignorant is in frames . . .

There are no markings, and of course, no documentation of any kind. I assume 700 means 700mm, so 700 / 25.4 = 27.56 inches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I measure the rim however, its diameter is approximately 25.1 inches.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I buy Continental tires, the size is 28 inch, but I have to buy 27 inch Bontrager tubes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, per this link, tires come in sizes of 26, 27, and 28 inch, and size 700. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.schwalbetires.com/bike_tires/road_tires/marathon_420&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.schwalbetires.com/bike_tires/road_tires/marathon_420&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How can I determine my wheel size, and are these various sizes interchangable. Also, is the 'C' suffix important, and what does it mean?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course the tires are marked, but I am under the impression (per the dealers comments) that Continental marks their tires differently than everyone else. Also, the tire markings don't help for ordering a new wheel. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With so many tire sizes available, how can I know if I am using the correct size.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After reading the various answers here, I should explain that my confusion on this matter stemmed from the fact that I used to work as an auto mechanic. In the auto industry, car tires are based on wheel size, 13&quot;, 14&quot;, 15&quot; etc, and there is no possible way to mount a 15&quot; tire on a 13&quot; rim for example.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So when I saw all these different tire sizes, I assumed they all required a different wheel size, but in fact, there is essentially just one wheel diameter for my type of bike, which they refer to as 700C, which is actually 622mm. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also initially assumed that the C referred to the wheel's width, but that isn't true either. The C is apparently just antiquated terminology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So at least in theory, I can mount a 26&quot;, 27&quot; 28&quot; or 29&quot; tire on my 700C (622mm) rim. I just need to verify the width of the tire is suitable my wheel width, which is what Sheldon Brown's article explains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, I measured my Continental tires, which are marked as 28 inch. They actually measure 27 inches (fully inflated), which must be why my dealer calls their sizing non standard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7875" LastEditorUserId="7875" LastEditDate="2013-08-26T10:25:56.153" LastActivityDate="2013-08-26T10:25:56.153" Title="How do I determine my wheel size" Tags="&lt;tire&gt;&lt;wheels&gt;&lt;repair&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="8" />
