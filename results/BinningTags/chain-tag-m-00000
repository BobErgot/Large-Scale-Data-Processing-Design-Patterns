I bought the Trek Allant brand new (2011) and I am using the bike for daily commuting to work, tarmac all the way. Most of it is flat apart from a bridge that has two 'medium steep' slopes. I clean the bike (incl chain) every two weeks and also give it a 'health check'. The chain gets lubricated with PTFE. I used the chain wear indicator (park tool) to check the chain and it's well over .75%. In addition the chain cassette shows signs of wear too. My cycle style is 'higher strokes' in a lower gear. I cycle for years and also have a Cannondale T1000 Touring bike that I bought back in the 90s. With that I do about 800-1200 miles on vacation, and have to change chains about once every two years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I expect the parts used on the Allant being of somewhat lower quality than those of a high-end bike, but I was just very surprised that the chain life is that short. Apart from the hassle of changing, the price for a 7-gear SRAM chain and cassette comes to a total of ~$30 (together) here in the UK.

Also, for vertical dropouts, where chainstay length is fixed, there might be a &quot;magical gear&quot; when you have almost zero chain-slack with the right combination of sprocket teeth number, chainring teeth number, and number of chain links.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For that reason, I plan to write some app (html+javascript) to get this length. There is a program which does exactely that, but it is not possible, as far as I know, to know which formula it uses, or if it is actually correct:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://eehouse.org/fixin/formfmu.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://eehouse.org/fixin/formfmu.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, I think the following assumptions should be made:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The chain perimeter is the sum of the distances between the consecutive centerlines of each pin;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The nominal distance between centerlines, in a new chain, is half an inch, or &quot;exactely&quot; 12.7mm;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The chain is considered to run a straight line between the tangent points where it touches each gear (sprocket or chainring);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The chain is considered a regular polygon sector along the circumference of the gears, as pointed by Lantius in his answer to the linked question.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The result would be the answer to the question: &quot;If I wrap a closed chain with N links around a spocket with S teeth and a chainring with C teeth and pull those apart, what would be the distance between the centerlines of the cog and the chainring?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: I'm including an &quot;updated&quot; drawing I generated programmatically (it's quite involving!), so it would be easier to analyze the geometry of the problem:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/qvV2j.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;X is the chainstay length, and it is the hypotenuse of the purple triangle, the short cathetus being R-r (known), and the longer cathetus being equal to B (unknown).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: (added trig formula) The whole length L of the chain (known) is equal to A+B+C+D.

They bent the hanger back into place and sent me on my way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tonight, on my first ride after the fix, the problem was happening again. Same deal, but less frequent. Shifting multiple cogs, especially right before/after a chainring shift would reproduce the problem with a high probability.

After cleaning them up and putting some grease on the threads, I put the cog back in and tightened it with no problems, but when I was tightening the lockring it disintegrated: it obviously cracked during the chain jam, which allowed it to move out without stripping the threads.

The old chain was a Shimano 9 speed that I installed 18 months and about 5000 miles ago.  It had stretched modestly and was full of winter cruft/grime.  The new chain is a SRAM 9 speed, my first time using the gold snap ring system.  I followed instructions and made sure I have the same link count as the chain that came off the bike.  The cassette was new with the old chain, so it has about 5000 miles on it and doesn't appear to have significant wear.  After installation and a clean/wipe/lube/wipe, I took it for a 15 mile easy ride at about 15-16 mph.  It shifts perfectly and I didn't have to make any adjustments to either derailleur.  Three times, however, when putting it under stain (once on a modest hill climb, once starting from a stop sign in a fairly big gear, and once on an acceleration coming out of a sharp turn) it skipped several teeth and caused my foot to slam down hard.  On the hill, it actually hurt as I had my weight off the saddle (not really standing) and I came down hard on the inside of my thigh.  I think all three were on the right side (power train side) pedal stroke, and I don't think they were all in the same gear.  I'm pretty sure it was the rear cassette that skipped, not the front chainring, but it did happen really fast each time.  I will also say that it's not like these were the only three times I put substantial pressure on the pedals in the ride - I wasn't going hard, but I wasn't being tentative or anything.  Also, in case it's relevant, it was cold, about 40 degrees F or about 4 degrees Centigrade.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My question:  Is this going to get me hurt, or will the new chain 'settle in' over a few rides?

I have had a look on Sheldon Brown I and have found several combinations of new rear cassette from an 11/28t, 12/25t, 12/21t to a 13/26t&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have found several 8-speed cassette's with these ranges. Shimano (HyperGlide) HG-70 , HG-50 and SRAM (PowerGlide) PG830 ,PG850&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However the HG-70-I is a new one on me I think it's an IG (Integrated Gear) I believe that the sprockets are thinner and closer together? Hhere is what Shimano website tells me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All current HG cassette cogs are specially profiled to be HG or IG chain compatible.&#xA;Any Shimano IG chain will work with any HG cassette. If you use a HG chain with a 7-speed IG cassette (CS-IG50 and CS-IG60) the rear derailleur adjustment becomes more critical.&#xA;One significant compatibility issue is always to avoid using a HG chain with an IG-only crank set. Why? The chain will release from the large (outer) chain rings too easily while in the larger rear cog. It may be possible that the chain drops off the outer ring without shifting the lever, when under full power.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also I have been told that I might need a longer rear mech to handle larger than 25t on the cassette not that I need to go any higher than 28t as I am running a triple chain set. I am not sure if my rear mech is a medium length if it helps my rear derailleur is a Shimano RD-2300 like the front.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any help would be appreciated I am sure that I can do this for about £30 (£20 cassette and £10 chain) but I want to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7775" LastActivityDate="2013-08-13T09:36:41.607" Title="Upgrade my Rear Cassette from 12/25t to 11/28t" Tags="&lt;chain&gt;&lt;cassette&gt;" CommentCount="1" />

If possible I'd keep the old 7 speed drive train the bike had together in case I ever find a use for it. The chain is an HG40 quick-link.
