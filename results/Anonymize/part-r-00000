If you ask us 3, that is a **lame advantage** and forwarding has all other advantages: faster to deliver (can't get any faster), cleaner (from looking at the mail source and headers), easier to setup (no passwords or ports needed) and more natural (*forwarding* is basically how mail servers talk among them - SMTP)."

I maintained a single connection to Google, and Google connected my AIM and gTalk buddies and a single address book there, and worked well till now.  When Google started dropping messages to my AIM buddies, I opted to just create a new Adium connection.  That's when I discovered this problem.  I don't believe it is Adium related because I removed both connections in Adium, shut it down and went over to just Google.
